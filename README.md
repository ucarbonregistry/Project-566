_______________
The proposed project titled under UCR is “8.4 MW Bundled Small Scale Wind Power Project in
Kutch, Gujarat”, which is a Wind Power project located in Kutch districts in the state of Gujarat
(India). The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being
applied under “Universe Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of 4 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) having capacity 4 x 2100 kW, each manufactured
and supplied by Suzlon Energy with aggregated installed capacity of 8.4 MW in district Kutch of
the state of Gujarat in India. This project has been promoted by M/s Meghmani Dyes and
Intermediates LLP, M/s Navratan Specialty Chemicals, and M/s Uniworth Enterprises.

The WTGs under the project activity were commissioned as per the below table:

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 14,716 MWh of electricity per
annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is being wheeled to manufacturing
facility of PP in Gujarat for captive consumption through NEWNE grid as per wheeling agreement
signed between Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Limited (GETCO) and PP. Through
utilization of renewable power at the manufacturing unit, the project activity would be displacing
equivalent quantum of grid electricity resulting in emission reduction of 13,245 tCO2 per annum.
The project activity has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using
renewable resources (wind energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated
using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal power plants.
The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected
to be 13,245 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification. Since the project activity generates electricity
through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source it will not cause any negative impact on the
environment and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
